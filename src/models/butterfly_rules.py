"""Butterfly stroke technique rules and thresholds."""

# --- Elbow / Arm Pull ---
# During the pull phase the arms stay relatively extended compared with
# freestyle's high-elbow catch.  A "dropped elbow" in butterfly means the
# elbows sink too low during the pull, losing leverage.
ARM_ENTRY_WIDTH_MIN = 0.20          # 20% of frame width – arms enter wide
ARM_ENTRY_WIDTH_MAX = 0.35          # 35% – too narrow reduces pull length
ELBOW_ANGLE_PULL_MIN = 120          # Minimal acceptable during pull phase
ELBOW_ANGLE_PULL_MAX = 160          # Healthy range
ELBOW_ANGLE_DROPPED = 160           # Above this → elbows too low

# --- Body Undulation (replaces body rotation) ---
# Butterfly uses vertical undulation rather than side-to-side rotation.
# Measured as vertical displacement of the hips over a stroke cycle,
# normalised by frame height.
UNDULATION_MIN = 0.04               # 4% of frame height – minimum healthy undulation
UNDULATION_MAX = 0.12               # 12% – too much undulation wastes energy
UNDULATION_TOO_FLAT = 0.03          # Below this → not undulating enough
UNDULATION_EXCESSIVE = 0.14         # Above this → over-undulating

# --- Head / Breathing ---
# Butterfly breathing is a forward lift, not a side rotation.
HEAD_LIFT_THRESHOLD = 0.08          # 8% of frame height – normal breathing lift
HEAD_LIFT_EXCESSIVE = 0.18          # 18% – lifting too high
BREATHING_EVERY_N_STROKES_MIN = 1   # Minimum strokes between breaths
BREATHING_EVERY_N_STROKES_MAX = 2   # Maximum recommended (sprinters breath every 1–2)

# --- Stroke Rate ---
STROKE_RATE_OPTIMAL_MIN = 30        # Distance butterfly (long course)
STROKE_RATE_OPTIMAL_MAX = 55        # Sprint butterfly
STROKE_RATE_TOO_SLOW = 25           # Below this → gliding too long
STROKE_RATE_TOO_FAST = 65           # Above this → rushing, likely poor catch

# --- Dolphin Kick ---
# Measured as knee angle during the downbeat of the dolphin kick.
# Dolphin kick involves a whole-body wave, so the knee angle is naturally
# more bent than in freestyle.
KNEE_ANGLE_OPTIMAL_MIN = 120
KNEE_ANGLE_OPTIMAL_MAX = 150
KNEE_ANGLE_TOO_STRAIGHT = 160       # Above this → not bending knees enough
KNEE_ANGLE_EXCESSIVE_BEND = 110     # Below this → too much knee, not enough hip drive

# --- Arm Synchronisation ---
# In butterfly both arms should enter and pull simultaneously.
# Measured as the absolute difference in wrist-x peak timestamps (in seconds).
SYNC_MAX_DELTA = 0.15               # Max allowed delay between left & right peaks

# --- Visibility ---
MIN_VISIBILITY = 0.5
